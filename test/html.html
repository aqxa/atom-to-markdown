<p>However, even if you do nothing and do not implement <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code>, some of the activity state is
restored by the <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a></code> class's default implementation of <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code>. Specifically, the default
implementation calls the corresponding <code><a href="/reference/android/view/View.html#onSaveInstanceState()">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code> method for every <code><a href="/reference/android/view/View.html">View</a></code> in the layout, which allows each view to provide information about itself
that should be saved. Almost every widget in the Android framework implements this method as
appropriate, such that any visible changes to the UI are automatically saved and restored when your
activity is recreated. For example, the <code><a href="/reference/android/widget/EditText.html">EditText</a></code> widget saves any text
entered by the user and the <code><a href="/reference/android/widget/CheckBox.html">CheckBox</a></code> widget saves whether it's checked or
not. The only work required of you is to provide a unique ID (with the <a href="/guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#idvalue"><code>android:id</code></a>
attribute) for each widget you want to save its state. If a widget does not have an ID, then the
system cannot save its state.</p>
